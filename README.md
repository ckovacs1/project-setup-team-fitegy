# Project Description

Fitegy is a social fitness app where users can choose or create their own workout challenges and send challenges to friends. Once users collect points through completing challenges, and can redeem these points for prizes and goods. 
Our product vision is to create a socially engaging way to stay healthy with friends. It can be difficult to find and maintain the motivation to exercise, and Fitegy strives to be that motivational gym buddy.

# History
Fitegy began with the idea that working out alone may be difficult to keep up with for beginners or those motivated by others or by challenges. The idea was proposed by Alex Ko and Cory Dublin to create a social app that keeps friends motivated to stay fit.
