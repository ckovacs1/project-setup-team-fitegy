# Guide to Contributing
## Our Values

<p>
<ul>
<li>Each team member will take responsibility for their own work.</li>
<li>Members who need help from team members can reach out directly to the team or privately to individual members, however they are most comfortable.</li>
<li>Conflict resolution:
<ul>
<li>If there are disagreements that cannot individually be resolved, the team can vote to resolve. If that does not work, the team can go to the professor or course assistant.</li>
<li>If a member does not meet their responsibilities, teammates will reach out to the team member. If the team member still fails to meet their responsibilities, the team will go to the professor or course assistant.</li>
<li>Team members should ideally respond within a day of messages. Of course, circumstances happen that can get in the way. If there are, the team member should (if possible) let the team know if they're having other obligations that they need to attend to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

## Sprint Cadence

<p>Sprints will take 2 weeks.</p>

## Daily Standups

<p>Daily standups will occur according to the schedule on the Knowledge Kitchen calendar. Meeting time will be decided according to the team's schedule for optimal time use. Members will be present synchronously. Members will not cover for other members, and those who make no progress for two or more standups in a row will be reported to management. Daily standups take place in person at the Laguardia coop.</p>
